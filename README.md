# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

1. Visit the Mars news site and inspect the page.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and extract text elements.
3. Store titles and preview text in Python data structures.
4. Print the list of dictionaries containing the scraped data.
5. Optional: Export the data to a JSON file.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

1. Visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and inspect the page.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and scrape the data.
3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Convert data types if necessary.
5. Analyze the data and create visualizations.
6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Results and Analysis

- Number of months on Mars
- Number of Martian days' worth of data
- Coldest and warmest months on Mars
- Months with lowest and highest atmospheric pressure
- Approximate number of terrestrial days in a Martian year

## Getting Started

Install the following libraries:
- Splinter
- Beautiful Soup
- Pandas
